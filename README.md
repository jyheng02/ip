## Acknowledgements

- **GUI Improvements (BetterGui):**  
  Certain implementations (e.g., error dialog integration, dynamic resizing and auto-scrolling, dialog bubble width binding) were adapted with assistance from [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) for guidance on JavaFX best practices.  
  Inline comments have been added in `MainWindow.java` and `DialogBox.java` to indicate where assistance was used.
